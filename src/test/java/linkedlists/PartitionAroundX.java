/**
 * 2.4
 *
 * Write code to partition around a linked list around value x, such that all nodes less than x come
 * before all nodes greater than or equal to x. If x is contained within the list, the value of x only
 * need to be after the elements less than x. The partition element x can appear anywhere in the
 * "right" partition; it does not need to appear between the left and right partitions
 *
 * EXAMPLE
 * Input: 3 -> 5 -> 8 -> 5 -> 10 -> 2 -> 1 [partition = 5]
 * Output: 3 -> 1 -> 2 -> 10 -> 5 -> 5 -> 8
